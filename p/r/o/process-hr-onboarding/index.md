Dear Robert,
We can hardly wait for you to start work at Smith-Klein. Your first day, next Tuesday is already full of meetings and opportunities for you to meet people with whom you’ll work closely.

The team plans to take you out to lunch for your first day so please reserve that time for the team lunch. As your new manager, I plan to take up the first couple of hours to review your new job and provide your orientation information.

We have set up a 90-day new employee orientation for you which provides at least one activity a day that will help you settle in. We believe that this drawn out orientation lays the appropriate groundwork for your success. We custom design one for every new employee based on the job and the new employee’s experience. As days go by, we can add to the plan as appropriate and deemed necessary for you as you take on your new role.

Your schedule for your first day is:

- 8:30 a.m. – 10:30 a.m. - Welcome meeting with me in my office to cover the basics about your new role.
- 10:30 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. – Settle into your new office. Mark Maroney from IT will join you make sure that your laptop, smartphone, and email settings are working and meet your needs.
- 11:30 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. – Lunch with the training and development team. Meet by the front door.
- 1:00 p.m. – 1:30 p.m. – Office time.
- 1:30 p.m. – 3:00 p.m. – Review and training on our products. You’ll need to understand what they do in depth. One of the trainers, Allan Snyder, will work with you. You can schedule additional time with Allan later this week.
- 3:00 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. – Meeting with Marcia Anatoli, the VP of finance to understand how finance and accounting operates and interact with your new role. Her staff will help you with all of your new employee paperwork, too.
- 4:30 p.m. – 5:00 p.m. Office time.

Your second day will involve the Human Resources component of your new employee orientation. Our HR manager, Dennis Birnbaum, is looking forward to spending some time with you.

The afternoon will be spent in the customer service department observing our interaction with customers. We want you to experience each department early in your orientation so that our company makes sense to you.

Working in customer service will give you a good feel for the needs and challenges that our customers experience in using our products. It is also important that you understand how your role has to interact with each department.

It is my pleasure to welcome you to Smith-Klein. I trust this letter clears up any concerns that you may have had about starting your new job.

If you have questions or need additional information, please feel free to call me. You will receive your new employee orientation package and the new job paperwork packet from Human Resources in the next day or two. If you have questions about the orientation package, please call our HR manager.

Warm regards,

Mary Beth Rivaldi
