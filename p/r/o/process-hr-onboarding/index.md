We are very happy to welcome you to the sales team here at Specialty Stones. You are joining us at an exciting time of year, as we are moving into our busiest season.

We are hopeful that with your fresh ideas and enthusiasm, this will be one of our best summers ever!

As we discussed during your interview, we are projecting unprecedented growth this year, and are counting on you to help us get there.

When you arrive on Monday, November 14, stop by my office and I'll show you to yours and introduce you to Marc and Karen who were out of town during your second interview. We are all looking forward to working with you and are certain that you'll be a great fit for this team. Welcome aboard!
